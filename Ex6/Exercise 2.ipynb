    "The encoding function is implemented using the quotient and remainder concept. \n",
    "For example, if the number to be encoded is 129, we divide it by M, which is 2 to the power of K. Let us assume K is 4, so M is 16. So, 129/16 gives us a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 1. The quotient is known as Q or R2, while the remainder is normally represented as R or R2. R2 (Q) will be encoded in unary, while R1 (R) will be encoded in binary. Thus, Q = 8 will be represented as a unary value of 111111110, while R = 1 will be represented as a binary value of 1. Then, we concatenate the Q + R and get 1111111101 as the encoded value."
